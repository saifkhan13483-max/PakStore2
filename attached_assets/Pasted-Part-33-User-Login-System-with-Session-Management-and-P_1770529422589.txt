Part 33: User Login System with Session Management and Password Recovery
Objective: Create secure login system with multiple authentication options, session management, and password recovery functionality.

Create Login page component in /src/pages/auth/Login.tsx with clean, trust-building design emphasizing security and convenience. Implement login form using React Hook Form with simplified validation: email field (required, valid format) and password field (required, minimum length). Add "Remember Me" checkbox providing user control over session persistence (though Firebase handles persistence automatically, checkbox builds user trust and provides familiar UX pattern). Create email/password login handler using Firebase's signInWithEmailAndPassword with comprehensive error handling for common scenarios: invalid credentials ("Invalid email or password"), user not found ("No account found with this email"), too many requests ("Too many failed attempts, please try again later"), and network errors. Implement Google Sign-In option with same styling and functionality as signup page ensuring consistent user experience across authentication flows. Add redirect logic checking for intended destination: if user was redirected to login from protected route, return to that route after successful authentication; otherwise, redirect to homepage or user dashboard. Create "Forgot Password" functionality with modal or separate page containing email input field, implementing Firebase's sendPasswordResetEmail function, showing success message with instructions to check inbox including spam folder, and handling errors like user not found or too many requests gracefully. Add security features including rate limiting on failed login attempts (track attempts in component state, show temporary lockout message after 5 failed attempts), display of last successful login time after authentication for security awareness, and clear session management with automatic token refresh. Implement loading states throughout authentication process disabling form inputs during submission, showing spinner on submit buttons, and preventing multiple simultaneous authentication attempts. Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility for all interactive elements.
