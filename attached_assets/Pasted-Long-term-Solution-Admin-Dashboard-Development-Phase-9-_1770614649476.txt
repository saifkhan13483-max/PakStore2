Long-term Solution: Admin Dashboard Development
Phase 9: Product Management System (7 Parts)
Part 36: Admin Authentication and Route Protection
Objective: Establish secure admin access integrated with your existing authentication system.

Extend your existing authentication store in /src/store/authStore.ts to include admin role checking. Add an isAdmin computed property that checks if the current user's email matches predefined admin emails or has an admin role in their Firestore user document. Create AdminRoute component in /src/components/admin/AdminRoute.tsx that wraps admin pages and redirects unauthorized users to the login page with appropriate error messages. Design AdminLayout component in /src/components/admin/AdminLayout.tsx with sidebar navigation containing Dashboard, Products, Orders, and Settings sections using shadcn navigation components. Implement breadcrumb navigation and admin-specific header with current admin user display and quick logout option. Style consistently with your established Tailwind configuration and Pakistani market color scheme.

Part 37: Firebase Storage Integration for Product Images
Objective: Enable secure image upload functionality for product management.

Configure Firebase Storage in your Firebase Console and update /src/lib/firebase.ts to include Storage initialization. Create comprehensive image upload hook /src/hooks/useImageUpload.ts that handles file selection validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP under 2MB), upload progress tracking with percentage display, automatic resizing for different use cases (thumbnail, medium, large), and secure storage path organization (products/{productId}/{imageType}/filename). Implement image compression using canvas API to optimize file sizes before upload while maintaining quality. Add error handling for upload failures, network issues, and storage quota exceeded scenarios. Create reusable ImageUploader component in /src/components/admin/ImageUploader.tsx with drag-and-drop functionality, preview capabilities, and progress indicators using shadcn Progress component.

Part 38: Product Management Dashboard
Objective: Create comprehensive product listing and management interface.

Develop /src/pages/admin/ProductList.tsx with advanced filtering and search capabilities. Implement data table using shadcn Table component displaying product thumbnail, name, SKU, price in PKR with proper formatting, stock quantity with low stock warnings, category, status (active/inactive), and action buttons (Edit, Delete, Duplicate). Add comprehensive filtering options: category dropdown, stock status filter, price range sliders, and text search across name and description fields. Implement bulk actions for status changes, category updates, and batch deletion with proper confirmation dialogs. Create sorting functionality for all columns with visual indicators. Add pagination with configurable page sizes and total results display. Implement real-time updates using Firestore listeners ensuring immediate reflection of changes made by multiple admin users.

Part 39: Advanced Product Form - Basic Information
Objective: Create comprehensive product creation and editing interface.

Build /src/pages/admin/ProductForm.tsx supporting both creation and editing modes based on URL parameters. Implement React Hook Form with comprehensive Zod validation schema covering all product fields. Create form sections: Basic Information (name with auto-slug generation, short description, detailed description with rich text editor), Pricing (current price, original price, cost price for margin calculation), Inventory Management (SKU generation, stock quantity, low stock threshold, track inventory toggle), and Categorization (category and subcategory dropdowns populated from Firestore categories collection). Add SEO section with meta title, meta description, and keywords fields for search optimization. Implement form auto-save functionality storing draft data in localStorage preventing data loss during long editing sessions. Add form validation with real-time error display and field-level validation feedback using shadcn Form components.

Part 40: Advanced Product Form - Images and Media
Objective: Integrate comprehensive media management into product forms.

Integrate the ImageUploader component from Part 37 into the product form with support for multiple image types: main product image, gallery images (up to 8), and optional video URL for product demonstrations. Implement drag-and-drop reordering for gallery images with visual feedback and smooth animations. Add image editing capabilities including crop tool for consistent aspect ratios, alt text input for accessibility, and image optimization settings. Create image variant generation automatically creating thumbnails and different sizes for various display contexts (listing cards, detail pages, cart thumbnails). Implement bulk image operations including batch upload, resize all images, and format conversion. Add image SEO optimization with automatic filename generation based on product name and proper metadata embedding.

Part 41: Product Form Submission and Firebase Integration
Objective: Complete product management workflow with robust data persistence.

Implement comprehensive form submission logic handling both creation and update operations. For new products, generate unique product ID, create Firestore document with complete product data including timestamps, upload all images to Firebase Storage with proper path organization, and update search indexes for product discovery. For existing products, implement selective field updates to avoid overwriting unchanged data, handle image additions/deletions with proper cleanup of orphaned storage files, maintain product history log for audit purposes, and trigger cache invalidation for updated products. Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages, retry mechanisms for failed operations, and rollback capabilities for partial failures. Implement success handling with toast notifications, automatic redirect to product list with success message, and optional "Save and Add Another" functionality for bulk product addition workflows.

Part 42: Frontend Integration and Real-time Updates
Objective: Connect admin changes to live customer-facing site with real-time synchronization.

Update all customer-facing components (/src/pages/Home.tsx, /src/pages/Products.tsx, /src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx) to use the useProducts and useProductBySlug hooks from your Firebase integration. Implement real-time product updates using Firestore onSnapshot listeners ensuring customers see inventory changes, price updates, and new products immediately without page refresh. Add loading states with skeleton components during data fetching and proper error boundaries for graceful failure handling. Implement caching strategy using React Query or SWR for improved performance while maintaining real-time capabilities for critical updates like stock changes. Create product availability notifications for customers when out-of-stock items become available again. Add search functionality using Firestore queries with text-based search capabilities and category filtering integrated with your existing filter system from earlier phases.

Implementation Strategy
Recommended Approach:
For Immediate Needs (1-2 days): Use Option 1 (Direct Mock Database) to add products quickly while maintaining your existing development workflow.

For Short-term Growth (1-2 weeks): Implement Option 2 (Firebase Migration) to enable dynamic product management while keeping development simple.

For Long-term Scalability (2-4 weeks): Complete Phase 9 (Admin Dashboard) for comprehensive product management capabilities suitable for growing business needs.

Integration with Existing Architecture:
This approach maintains consistency with your established patterns:

Uses existing wouter routing for admin pages
Integrates with Zustand authentication store
Follows shadcn/ui component patterns
Maintains Tailwind CSS styling consistency
Preserves hybrid localStorage/Firebase persistence strategy
Continues phase-based development methodology
