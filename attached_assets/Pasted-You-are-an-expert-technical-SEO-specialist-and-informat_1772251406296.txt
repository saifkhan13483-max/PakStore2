You are an expert technical SEO specialist and information architect.
Your task is to design and output a complete SEO‑friendly XML sitemap for a modern e‑commerce SPA called PakCart.

Context about the site (important, use this to infer structure):

PakCart is a serverless e-commerce platform.
Tech stack:
Frontend: React 18 + Vite (TypeScript)
Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
State: TanStack Query v5 (server state), Zustand (global UI state, auth, cart)
Routing: wouter (SPA routing)
Backend / services:
Database: Firebase Firestore (Products, Categories, Orders, Users, etc.)
Auth: Firebase Auth (RBAC for admin dashboard)
Media: Cloudinary (optimized product images)
Features:
Product listing with pagination, category filters, search filters
Product detail pages
Cart, checkout, orders
Role‑based admin dashboard for managing products & orders
Fully responsive, mobile‑first design
Deployment: static SPA on Vercel/Replit (dist/ bundle), with client-side routing.
Assume the canonical production domain is:

https://www.example.com
(Replace this with the domain I will give you.)

1. Goals
Propose a logical, scalable URL structure for:
Home
Category listing pages
Product listing & pagination
Product detail pages
Search / filter pages (only where appropriate for SEO)
Informational pages (About, Contact, FAQs, etc.) if applicable
Auth (login/register) pages
Cart / checkout / order-confirmation
Admin dashboard areas (should be excluded from indexing)
Then, based on that structure, generate a production‑ready XML sitemap that:
Follows XML sitemap protocol
Uses <loc>, <lastmod>, <changefreq>, and <priority> appropriately
Is optimized specifically for an e‑commerce site
Avoids thin/duplicate/low-value URLs
2. URL & SEO rules
Follow these rules:

Use clean, human‑readable, keyword‑friendly slugs:
Categories: /category/electronics, /category/men-shoes
Products: /product/slugified-product-name
Do not include:
Admin URLs (e.g., /admin, /admin/products, /admin/orders)
Auth-only sections like /dashboard if user-specific
Cart / checkout / account pages in sitemap if they’re not meant to rank
You may include a generic:
/login, /register if they have a marketing/SEO purpose (optional)
For pagination:
Include important paginated category pages only if they are indexable and unique enough. Example: /category/electronics?page=2
Otherwise, prefer canonicalization and do not list every page.
For filtered pages (by brand, price, attributes), be conservative:
Only include high-value, evergreen filter combinations if they realistically should rank (e.g., /category/phones?brand=samsung), otherwise exclude.
3. Required sections in your answer
A. URL architecture plan (short explanation)

Briefly describe the recommended URL structure for:
Homepage
Category pages
Product pages
Optional content (blog/help/FAQ) if you think it benefits SEO
Which types of pages are:
Included in the sitemap (indexable)
Excluded (admin, cart, checkout, user private pages, etc.)
B. Example URLs (generic, but realistic)
2. Provide a short list of example URLs for each section (use generic sample slugs):

5+ categories
8–10 products mapped under categories
3–5 informational pages (e.g., /about, /contact, /faq, /shipping-returns)
C. XML sitemap output
3. Then generate an XML sitemap for https://www.example.com (I will replace the domain later) with:

Proper header:
Copy<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
One <url> entry per selected URL:
<loc>: full canonical URL
<lastmod>: use realistic ISO format placeholders like 2024-01-15 (I’ll update later)
<changefreq>: decide per URL type
Home: daily or weekly
Categories: daily or weekly
Products: weekly or monthly
Static info pages: monthly or yearly
<priority> (0.1–1.0):
Home: 1.0
Top categories: 0.8–0.9
Products: 0.5–0.7 based on importance
Info pages: ~0.4–0.6
Close with </urlset>.

Only output one XML sitemap file (no index-sitemap split needed) but design it so it can be scaled later.
4. Constraints and notes
Assume the website is a single-page application (SPA), but search engines can fully crawl the rendered routes.
Avoid including any obviously session-based or temporary URLs.
Do not invent real brands—use generic placeholders like brand-x instead.
The final answer must be in two clear parts:
Explanation & URL architecture (human-readable)
The final XML sitemap code block (machine-ready), using https://www.example.com as the base URL.
Use the technical details above about PakCart (Firestore collections, Cloudinary images, client-side routing, etc.) to make smart, realistic assumptions about category and product URL patterns, but keep the XML sitemap focused on HTML pages only, not on image or media sitemaps.
