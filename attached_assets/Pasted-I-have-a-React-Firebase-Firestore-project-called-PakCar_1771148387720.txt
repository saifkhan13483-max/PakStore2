I have a React + Firebase + Firestore project called PakCart that I built with Replit.
Tech stack: React 18, Vite, Firebase Auth, Firestore, TanStack Query, Zustand.

I want to implement a proper admin system and make sure there are two admins:

My email (owner): saifkhan16382@gmail.com
My friend’s email: ch.ayan.arain786@gmail.com
Right now:

Firebase Auth is set up and both of us appear in the Firebase Auth “Users” list.
In Firestore, there is a users collection where the document ID is the Firebase UID.
A user document currently has at least photoURL and updatedAt, but there is no role or isAdmin field yet.
I want the app’s admin dashboard / admin-only pages to be available only to users who are admins.
Your tasks:

Find where admin access is currently controlled

Search the codebase for:
isAdmin
role === "admin"
admin in auth or routing code
or any hardcoded email checks (like user.email === "something").
Identify the component(s) / file(s) that:
Protect admin routes (like AdminRoute, ProtectedRoute, or router config)
Render the admin dashboard or admin pages
Manage auth state (Zustand authStore, React context, or similar)
Implement role-based admin using Firestore

In the users collection in Firestore, I want a field to mark admins.
Use this schema:
role: "admin" for admins
Optionally role: "user" for regular users
Update the code so that:
On login, the app loads the user’s Firestore profile (from users/{uid}).
It stores the profile (including role) in the existing auth state (Zustand or context).
isAdmin is derived from profile.role === "admin".
Admin access logic

Replace any hardcoded admin email checks with a role-based check.

Centralize the logic like this (you can adjust to fit existing patterns):

Copy// Example shape — adapt to current auth store / context
type UserProfile = {
  uid: string;
  email: string;
  role?: "admin" | "user";
  photoURL?: string;
  // other fields if needed
};

const isAdmin = profile?.role === "admin";
Use this isAdmin to:

Protect admin-only routes.
Hide or show admin UI (menus, buttons, etc).
Ensure both specific emails become admins

Make sure the code does not hardcode these emails for checks.
But I want a small utility script or function that, when run once, will:
Look up the user document for:
saifkhan16382@gmail.com
ch.ayan.arain786@gmail.com
Set role: "admin" on both.
If you can’t run it automatically, at least:
Print out clear instructions in comments for how I should:
Find the two UIDs
Create or update users/{uid} documents in Firestore
Add role: "admin" there.
Update route protection

Find the router configuration (wouter or whatever is used).
Make an AdminRoute or equivalent that:
Redirects to / (or /login) if !isAdmin.
Allows access if isAdmin.
Make sure all admin pages go through this guard.
Explain in comments what I need to manually do in Firebase

In code comments or a short README section, add step‑by‑step notes:
How to add a new admin later:
User signs up / logs in.
Go to Firestore → users collection → find or create users/{uid}.
Set role to "admin".
That’s it—no code change needed.
Don’t break existing functionality

Keep current login/signup flows working.
If something is already using authStore or TanStack Query, integrate role loading into that instead of replacing it.
Make minimal but clean and consistent changes.
After you make the changes:

Show me:
The key modified files (paths and code snippets).
Exactly where in the Firebase Console I must click to set role: "admin" for my friend.
Also, point out where in the code I can quickly add console logs if I need to debug isAdmin.
If anything in the codebase is unclear, inspect it and choose the cleanest, simplest approach that fits the existing patterns.
