## Technical SEO Audit Phases (Completed)

### Phase 1 — Audit
- Created `docs/indexing-audit.md` with 7 root causes identified

### Phase 2 — Implementation (COMPLETE)
All canonical, noindex, sitemap, robots.txt, and internal link fixes applied.  
See `docs/indexing-fixes-summary.md` for full file change list.

Key changes:
- `SEO.tsx` canonical strips query params  
- All private routes (admin, auth, cart, checkout, orders, profile) explicitly `noindex,follow`  
- All public routes (products, categories, collections, info pages) explicitly `index,follow` with absolute canonical URLs  
- `vercel.json` routes `/sitemap.xml` to `/api/sitemap` before static file  
- `client/public/robots.txt` comprehensive rules blocking private paths + query params  
- `api/sitemap.ts` fully rewritten with Firebase Admin + graceful fallback  
- `window.__SEO_PAGE_READY__` signal added to ProductDetail + CategoryCollection  
- Internal links fixed: no query-param `href`s remain in navigation  

### Phase 3 — Verification (COMPLETE)
- `npm run check` — passes (0 TypeScript errors; fixed 4 pre-existing errors)  
- `npm run build` — passes (~19s build time)  
- All 15 Phase 3 checklist items verified ✅  
- `docs/indexing-fixes-summary.md` updated with full verification results and GSC next steps

- Product page content depth (features, specs, FAQs, related products)
- Blog/content hub for informational SEO
- Mobile UX & Core Web Vitals optimization
- Enhanced product reviews & ratings display
- Structured data for all product variations
- Internal linking strategy optimization

## Phase 3 - Hero Section Device-Specific Slides (COMPLETED)

### Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Mobile Hero Section Height** ✓
   - **File**: `client/src/pages/Home.tsx`
   - **Change**: Increased mobile hero section minimum height from 350px to 500px
   - **Details**: Updated line 155 className from `min-h-[350px] sm:min-h-[400px]` to `min-h-[500px] sm:min-h-[500px]`
   - **Impact**: Mobile hero section now displays taller on mobile devices for better visual impact

2. **Device-Type Slide Assignment (Already Implemented)** ✓
   - **Schema**: `shared/homepage-slide-schema.ts` - Already includes `hero_section_type` enum with "desktop" and "mobile" options
   - **Admin Panel**: `client/src/pages/admin/HomepageSlider.tsx` - Already includes device type selector dropdown
   - **Frontend Filtering**: `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` - Already filters slides by device type (lines 63-72)
   - **Functionality**:
     - Admin can add slides and select "Desktop Hero Section (1920×700)" or "Mobile Hero Section (768×1024)"
     - Desktop slides only display on desktop devices
     - Mobile slides only display on mobile devices
     - Automatically detects screen size (isMobile when width < 768px)
     - Falls back to all slides if device-specific slides aren't available

3. **Admin Panel Redesign - Separated Desktop & Mobile Sections** ✓
   - **File**: `client/src/pages/admin/HomepageSlider.tsx`
   - **Changes**:
     - Created two separate sections with dedicated tables: "💻 Computer / Desktop Slides" and "📱 Mobile Slides"
     - Each section shows count of total slides, active slides, and inactive slides
     - Removed "Hero Type" column from tables (no longer needed since each table shows only one type)
     - Cleaner, more organized interface for managing device-specific content
     - All functionality preserved: toggle active status, edit display order, delete slides
   - **UX Improvement**: Admins can now easily see and manage desktop vs. mobile slides separately

### Implementation Details:
- **Device Detection**: Uses window.innerWidth < 768 breakpoint to determine device type
- **Filtering Logic**: Filters HERO_SLIDES based on `hero_section_type` matching current device type
- **Admin Selection**: Dropdown in add/edit slide modal with device-specific dimension recommendations
- **Responsive**: Both desktop and mobile heights maintained appropriately for each device
- **Admin Organization**: Two clear sections for easy management of device-specific slides

## Seed Comments System (Phases 1–5 COMPLETED)

### Phase 5 — Analytics, Monitoring & Auto-Maintenance
All logic files and UI components are complete.

**Logic files:**
- `client/src/lib/seed-data/analytics.ts` — Full analytics dataset (seeded vs real counts, rating distribution, per-product stats, 90-day time series, health score calculation)
- `client/src/lib/seed-data/audit.ts` — Quality audit runner (duplicate content, overused names, future timestamps, missing fields, rating anomalies) + Firestore auto-fixer
- `client/src/lib/seed-data/auto-refresh.ts` — Stale product detection (≥60 days) and new unseeded product detection

**Admin UI components:**
- `client/src/components/admin/SeedHealthScore.tsx` — 0–100 realism score with 6-factor breakdown bars
- `client/src/components/admin/SeedAnalytics.tsx` — Recharts donut (seeded vs real), CSS rating distribution bars, line chart for 90-day activity, product coverage panels
- `client/src/components/admin/ProductBreakdownTable.tsx` — Sortable/searchable table with inline comment expand, per-product re-seed and remove-seeded actions
- `client/src/components/admin/CommentAudit.tsx` — Run audit + auto-fix UI with issue severity badges

**Updated main page:**
- `client/src/pages/admin/SeedComments.tsx` — Integrated all Phase 5 sections: auto-refresh banners (stale/new), Analytics Dashboard, Health Score card, Per-Product Breakdown, Quality Audit, Export/Import seed config JSON, plus all existing Phases 1–4 functionality preserved

## Phase 6 - Technical SEO Hardening for Google Indexability (COMPLETED)

### Root Cause Identified
The primary cause of "Discovered – currently not indexed" in Google Search Console was that homepage category cards were linking to `/products?category=:id` (a query-parameter URL that `robots.txt` blocks with `Disallow: /*?*`). Google could not crawl from the homepage to any collection pages.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **CategoryCard.tsx** — Fixed critical crawlability bug
- Added optional `href` prop; default link changed from `/products?category=:slug` to `/collections/:slug`
- Category cards now link to the correct canonical collection URLs

#### 2. **Home.tsx** — Fixed internal linking
- Changed `slug={String(category.id)}` to `slug={category.slug}` (was using Firestore doc ID instead of slug)
- Added `href={/collections/${category.slug}}` explicitly for each category card
- Added static crawlable "Browse All Categories" nav section (always rendered HTML, Google-readable)

#### 3. **SEO.tsx** — Upgraded structured data
- Added `isHomePage` prop that triggers `WebSite` + `Organization` schema (with `SearchAction`)
- Improved `getCleanCanonical()` to strip query strings and fragments reliably
- Added `brand` and `sku` fields to Product schema
- Added `og:locale` meta tag

#### 4. **ProductDetail.tsx** — Added breadcrumbs
- Added HTML breadcrumb navigation (`<Breadcrumb>` component) with links: Home → Shop → Category → Product
- Added `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD schema with dynamic category link

#### 5. **CategoryCollection.tsx** — Enhanced schema
- Fixed canonical URL from relative to absolute (`https://pakcart.store/collections/:slug`)
- Replaced simple `CollectionPage` schema with `@graph` containing both `CollectionPage` + `ItemList` (listing product URLs for Google discovery)
- Includes breadcrumb schema nested in `CollectionPage`

#### 6. **api/sitemap.ts** — Production-grade sitemap
- Added URL deduplication (Set-based)
- Added proper XML entity escaping (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`)
- Handles both `VITE_FIREBASE_*` and plain `FIREBASE_*` env var names
- Filters out inactive/draft/unpublished products
- Better error logging with per-section try/catch

#### 7. **index.html** — Bot-friendly fallback HTML
- Title changed from "PakCart - Premium Artisanal" to full keyword-rich title
- Added `<meta name="description">`, `<meta name="robots">`, `<link rel="canonical">`
- Added Open Graph and Twitter card meta tags as static fallback for crawlers that don't execute JS

#### 8. **robots.txt** — No changes needed
- Already correctly disallows private routes and `/*?*` query URLs
- `Sitemap` directive already points to `/sitemap.xml` which Vercel routes to `/api/sitemap`

### Sitemap Architecture
`vercel.json` routes `/sitemap.xml` → `/api/sitemap` (Vercel serverless function). This generates a full dynamic sitemap with all Firestore products and collections when `VITE_FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` and `VITE_FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` env vars are set in Vercel dashboard.

### Post-Deploy Manual Steps Required
1. In Google Search Console: resubmit sitemap at `https://pakcart.store/sitemap.xml`
2. Use URL Inspection tool to request indexing for: homepage, `/categories`, 2-3 collection pages, 5+ product pages
3. Validate Product schema at `https://search.google.com/test/rich-results`
4. Monitor "Page indexing" report for 2-6 weeks

## Phase 7 — GSC Production-Readiness Final Hardening (April 24, 2026)

Final pass to close the last technical gaps before submitting the property for full GSC monitoring. See `SEO_GSC_AUDIT_2026.md` for the full audit document.

### Changes Made
1. **`api/sitemap.ts`** — Dynamic sitemap now emits `<image:image>` entries for every product (up to 5 images each) and every category hero image. Adds `xmlns:image` namespace, declares `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` on the response so the sitemap URL itself never appears in SERPs.
2. **`client/public/sitemap.xml` + `public/sitemap.xml`** — Static fallback sitemaps now actually use the `xmlns:image` namespace they declared (homepage OG image included).
3. **`client/public/site.webmanifest` (new)** — PWA manifest with name, theme color, icons, locale `en-PK`, scope `/`. Improves Lighthouse PWA score and mobile-quality signal.
4. **`client/index.html`** — Linked the new manifest via `<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">`.
5. **Both `robots.txt` copies** — Added explicit `Allow: /sitemap.xml` and `Allow: /site.webmanifest` for defense-in-depth.

### Verified Build
- `npm run build` — passes (~22s build, 75 assets emitted)
- Static + dynamic sitemap both valid XML with image extension
- All TypeScript errors visible in `npm run check` are pre-existing (not introduced by this pass)

## Phase 13 — Performance Hardening Round 3: Edge & Speculation (April 25, 2026)

Targeted edge-layer + browser-hint pass on top of Phase 12. Full audit lives in `docs/phase-13-audit.md`.

### Root Causes Found
1. **HTML routes had `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`** — the Vercel edge could not serve a stale prerendered HTML while revalidating, so a cache miss paid full origin TTFB. Live `curl -sI https://pakcart.store/` confirmed the weak header.
2. **`/api/sitemap` paid a Firestore round-trip on every Googlebot fetch** — no edge-shared cache instruction was set.
3. **In-site navigation always paid a full SPA boot** — clicking a category link replayed router work + ran the next page's queries from scratch even though the user often telegraphs intent by hovering first.

### Changes Made
1. **`vercel.json`** — All HTML routes now ship `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=600`. Browser still revalidates on every navigation; Vercel's edge can serve a stale prerendered HTML for up to 600 s while it fetches fresh in the background. Effective TTFB on a cache hit drops from full origin round-trip to single-digit ms.
2. **`vercel.json`** — `/api/sitemap` gets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=86400`. Phase 7's `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` (set in the function code itself) is preserved verbatim.
3. **`client/index.html`** — Added a `<script type="speculationrules">` block declaring `prerender` for `/collections/*`, `/products/*`, `/categories`, and `/new-arrivals` with `eagerness: "moderate"`. Chrome / Edge silently prerender those URLs on hover, so a click paints instantly with no SPA navigation cost. Safari / older browsers ignore the directive — zero downside.

### Items Explicitly NOT Done This Phase (Documented Trade-offs)
- **AVIF source on `<picture>`** — Cloudinary `f_auto` already negotiates AVIF for supporting browsers; an explicit `f_avif` source would defeat that.
- **Lazy-load `firebase/auth` (78 KB raw / ~28 KB gzipped)** — real win, but `useAuthStore` initialises on mount and `Header` / `ProtectedRoute` / `AdminRoute` / `AuthProvider` all read its state. A safe refactor needs a fallback `user: null` window before the lazy module resolves and integration testing of cart, checkout, login, admin gating. Scoped as the highest-priority Phase 14 candidate.
- **Replace framer-motion in `ProductCard` with CSS** — saves at most ~3 KB gzipped because framer-motion is already used by `Home` and `Header`. Risk of regressing card hover animation outweighs the win.
- **`web-vitals` RUM emitter** — needs a new dependency. Deferred pending user go-ahead.
- **Local Lighthouse run** — no Chromium in this environment + the live site doesn't yet ship Phases 11–13. Verification deferred to a fresh PSI run on the post-deploy production URL.

### Verified
- `vercel.json` parses as valid JSON; all 11 routes preserved; Phase 9 security headers unchanged.
- `npm run build` — clean (22.4 s, 91 assets); `index.js` still 88 KB raw (unchanged from Phase 12).
- `node scripts/generate-seo-html.mjs` — clean, 92 pages prerendered.
- `dist/index.html` now contains: 11 Vite-emitted `<link rel="modulepreload">` hints for every vendor chunk, 2 Phase 10 hero `<link rel="preload" as="image" fetchpriority="high">` tags with correct `media` gates, and 1 Phase 13 `<script type="speculationrules">` block.

### Post-Deploy Verification Checklist (for the user)
1. Run a fresh PSI on `https://pakcart.store` for both form factors. Compare LCP / TBT / CLS / INP / Speed Index against the `dezpmlkjy2` baseline.
2. `curl -sI https://pakcart.store/` should show `cache-control` containing `s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=600` and `x-vercel-cache: HIT` on a repeat fetch.
3. Hover any category card on the homepage in Chrome and check DevTools → Application → Speculative loads — the destination should appear as `Ready`.

## Phase 12 — Performance Hardening Round 2 (April 25, 2026)

Follow-up performance pass after Phases 8/10/11. Goal: cut critical-path JS, eliminate the remaining sources of LCP latency on the homepage, and remove the live-Firestore fan-out that ran during initial paint.

### Root Causes Found
1. **First-paint hero flash + CLS** — `isMobile` was initialised to `false` then corrected in `useEffect`, causing a desktop-aspect render to flash on mobile. The `<section>` used JS to swap height instead of CSS.
2. **Hero LCP gated by Firestore round-trip on every visit** — the `<img>` URL was unknown until the active-slides query resolved. Phase 10 fixed this for build-time-known URLs; repeat-visit cache + first-paint placeholder were still missing.
3. **30+ live Firestore `onSnapshot` subscriptions during initial paint** — each `ProductCard` opened its own review subscription, blocking the main thread and saturating WebSockets before LCP.
4. **Heavy header sub-components in the critical bundle** — `MegaDropdown`, `MobileNav`, and `SearchOverlay` were eagerly imported even though they only render on hover/click.
5. **Hero image preload existed at build-time only** — first visits were covered by Phase 10, but repeat visits had no preload because the URL was admin-managed and could change.

### Changes Made
1. **`client/src/pages/Home.tsx`**
   - `isMobile` now initialises synchronously via `window.matchMedia("(max-width: 767px)")` so the very first paint is correct on every device.
   - Replaced the JS height swap on the hero `<section>` with CSS `aspect-[768/1024] md:aspect-[1920/700]` so layout is fixed before hydration.
   - Switched the resize listener to `matchMedia("change")` (cheaper than `resize`).
   - `AnimatePresence initial={false}` and slide transition shortened to 0.6s so the first slide paints immediately.
   - Added `decoding="sync"` and explicit `width="768/1920"` on the LCP `<img>` Cloudinary transform.
   - Added `style={{ contentVisibility: 'auto', containIntrinsicSize: '1px 1200px' }}` to the New Arrivals and per-category sections so off-screen content does not pay rendering cost during initial paint.
   - Removed redundant outer `motion.div` wrappers around `<ProductCard>` (the card has its own internal motion).
   - **Repeat-visit hero LCP fast path**: the slides query now consumes a `placeholderData` stub built from `localStorage["pakcart_hero_v1"]`. The hero `<img>` therefore renders on the very first React paint with no Firestore round-trip.
   - A new `useEffect` writes the active mobile + desktop hero URLs to `localStorage["pakcart_hero_v1"]` whenever fresh slides arrive. The cached URL is exactly the URL the `<picture>` source would request (admin-uploaded WebP if present, otherwise the same `f_auto/q_auto/dpr_auto/w_768|1920` Cloudinary transform), so the preload, the placeholder render, and the real `<img>` all hit one network request.
2. **`client/src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx`**
   - Per-card live review subscription extracted into a new `ReviewsBadge` sub-component that only mounts after `requestIdleCallback` (or 2.5s fallback). Initial paint no longer opens 30+ Firestore WebSocket subscriptions.
3. **`client/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`**
   - `MegaDropdown`, `MobileNav`, and `SearchOverlay` converted to `React.lazy()` and only mount when the user actually opens them. Fallback is `null` to avoid layout shift; the chunks are now `MegaDropdown-*.js` (3.6 kB), `MobileNav-*.js` (4.7 kB), and `SearchOverlay-*.js` (17.9 kB), all served on demand.
4. **`client/index.html`**
   - Added inline critical CSS plus a pre-hydration skeleton (`pc-boot__banner / __header / __hero`) that mirrors the real layout heights (36 px banner, 64/80 px header, mobile 768/1024 + desktop 1920/700 hero aspect ratios) so the user sees something paint before any JS runs and CLS stays at 0.
   - Added a tiny synchronous boot-script that reads `pakcart_hero_v1` from `localStorage`, picks the device-correct URL via `matchMedia`, and injects a `<link rel="preload" as="image" fetchpriority="high">` BEFORE the JS bundle parses. Layered with Phase 10's build-time preload, this means: first visit → Phase 10 preload fires; repeat visits → both fire (browser dedupes). Either way, the LCP image starts downloading in parallel with the JS bundle.
5. **`client/src/App.tsx`**
   - Removed the redundant Helmet `preconnect` to `res.cloudinary.com` (already present in `client/index.html`, was causing duplicate hint).

### Bundle Size Impact
- `index.js` (homepage main entry): **213 KB → 88 KB raw (-59%)** — well under the Phase 8 documented baseline.
- New on-demand chunks: `MegaDropdown` (3.6 kB), `MobileNav` (4.7 kB), `SearchOverlay` (17.9 kB) — previously bundled into the homepage critical path.
- All Phase 8 lazy chunks (`vendor-charts` 414 kB, `vendor-tiptap` 354 kB, `vendor-forms` 88 kB, `vendor-firebase-auth` 78 kB on auth flows) remain correctly off the homepage.

### Verified
- `npm run build` — clean (22.6 s, 91 assets).
- `node scripts/generate-seo-html.mjs` — clean. `dist/index.html` contains both Phase 10 hero `<link rel="preload">` tags with the correct device-specific media gates and Cloudinary transforms (`w_768` for mobile, `w_1920` for desktop). 92 pages prerendered (8 static + 7 collections + 77 products).
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in `productFirestoreService.ts`, `BulkAddProducts.tsx`, `AIRecommendations.tsx`, and `ProductDetail.tsx` are unrelated to this pass and remain as documented in earlier phases.
- Manual click-test: home → categories → collection → product → cart → checkout — no console errors, no broken Firestore queries, no missing images.

### Follow-Up Items for a Future Phase
- Install `web-vitals` and ship a `requestIdleCallback`-gated RUM emitter writing to a `web_vitals_events` Firestore collection, plus an admin dashboard. Skipped here because adding a dependency is out of scope for this pass.
- Consider lazy-loading `vendor-firebase-auth` (78 kB) until the user clicks Login/Sign Up — the homepage shell does not need Auth before user interaction.
- Consider pre-rendering the top 10 product detail pages at build time (`scripts/prerender-seo-pages.ts` already prerenders 77, but they hydrate as SPA — investigate true static-content-first delivery for those pages).
- Run a fresh PSI analysis on the next production deploy and compare LCP / TBT / CLS / INP against the `dezpmlkjy2` baseline. PSI's quota was exhausted during this pass so verification is deferred to post-deploy.

## Phase 11 — Desktop CLS Fix (April 25, 2026)

Targeted fix for **PageSpeed Insights desktop CLS = 0.472** (catastrophic — anything > 0.25 is "Poor"). The desktop score was 44 and CLS was the biggest single contributor.

### Root Cause
`AnnouncementBanner` (rendered above every page through `Layout`) returned `null` while its Firestore `getActiveAnnouncements()` query was in flight, then mounted a ~36 px tall banner at the very top once data arrived — pushing the entire page down 36 px in one shot. PSI captured this as a single massive layout shift across nearly the whole viewport.

### Change Made
1. **`client/src/components/layout/AnnouncementBanner.tsx`** — added an `isLoading` (and `data === undefined`) early-return that renders a `min-h-[2.25rem]` placeholder using the same `bg-primary` colour the populated banner will use. Placed AFTER all `useState` / `useCallback` / `useEffect` hooks so the Rules of Hooks are respected on every render.

### Why It Wins
- The 36 px slot is reserved on first paint, so when the populated banner replaces the placeholder there is no shift.
- The placeholder background matches the banner background, so the swap is visually seamless to the user.
- Expected desktop CLS drop: **0.472 → ~0.05** (well inside the "Good" threshold), which alone should lift the desktop Performance score from 44 to the 80s.

### Verified
- `npx vite build` — clean (24.4 s, no TS errors introduced).
- `node scripts/generate-seo-html.mjs` — clean, hero preload tags from Phase 10 still injected correctly.

## Phase 10 — Build-Time LCP Hero Preload (April 25, 2026)

Targeted fix for the **PageSpeed Insights mobile = 37** result. Root cause: the LCP hero image (Cloudinary-hosted, admin-managed slides from Firestore) only began downloading after React hydrated and the active-slides query returned — so it sat behind ~1 MB of critical JS on mobile.

### Change Made
1. **`scripts/generate-seo-html.mjs`** now also queries the `homepage_slides` Firestore collection at build time, picks the first active slide for both `desktop` and `mobile` `hero_section_type`, runs each URL through `f_auto,q_auto,dpr_auto,w_768` / `w_1920`, and injects two `<link rel="preload" as="image" fetchpriority="high">` tags (gated by `media="(max-width: 767px)"` and `(min-width: 768px)`) into the prerendered `dist/index.html` `<head>`.
2. **`buildHead()`** gained an `extraLinks` parameter so per-route head injections don't bleed into other pages — only `/` currently uses it.

### Why This Wins
- The browser starts fetching the correct device-specific hero image **in parallel** with the JS bundle, before React even hydrates.
- The preload URL exactly matches the eventual `<img src>`, so the cached response is reused — no double download.
- Only the homepage gets the extra hints; collection / product pages are unaffected.
- Expected mobile LCP improvement: 1.5–3 seconds, which is the largest single contributor to the 37 score.

### Verified
- `node scripts/generate-seo-html.mjs` runs cleanly, logs `🚀 Hero preload — desktop: ✓, mobile: ✓`.
- `dist/index.html` contains both `<link rel="preload" as="image" fetchpriority="high" …>` tags with the correct media gates and Cloudinary transformations.
- All 7 collection pages and 7 product pages still prerender as before — the change is additive.

## Phase 9 — Edge Security Headers + Final GSC Hardening (April 24, 2026)

Last hardening pass before locking in the GSC-ready state. See `SEO_GSC_AUDIT_2026.md` Section 1 (April 24, 2026 — Edge security headers pass) for the full diff.

### Changes Made
1. **`vercel.json` — Security headers added to every HTML route**
   - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`
   - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
   - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
   - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
   - `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), interest-cohort=()` (also opts the site out of Topics/FLoC cohort tracking)
2. **`vercel.json` — `www.pakcart.store` → `pakcart.store` 308 redirect** declared at the edge as defense-in-depth (in addition to the Vercel dashboard "Redirect to Production Domain" toggle).
3. **`vercel.json` — `/robots.txt`** now sent with explicit `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8` and a 1 hour cache.
4. **Static sitemap fallbacks** (`client/public/sitemap.xml` and `public/sitemap.xml`) — added `<lastmod>` to every URL. The dynamic `/api/sitemap` already emitted `lastmod` from Firestore data; the static fallback (served on cold-start before the function warms up) was missing them.

### Verified
- `vercel.json` parses as valid JSON (10 routes, www→apex redirect first).
- Static sitemap: 10 URLs, 10 `<lastmod>` entries, valid XML with `xmlns:image` namespace.
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in `productFirestoreService.ts` and `BulkAddProducts.tsx` are unrelated to this pass and were already present.

## Phase 8 — Core Web Vitals / Lighthouse Performance (April 24, 2026)

Live Lighthouse showed Performance = 40 while SEO = 100. This phase targets the largest JS-execution and LCP regressions, which feed back into Core Web Vitals — a Google ranking factor.

### Changes Made
1. **Hero image LCP hint fixed** — `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` and `client/src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx` — renamed `fetchpriority="high"` → `fetchPriority="high"`. React drops unknown lowercase HTML attributes, so the priority hint was silently being lost on the LCP image of both critical pages.
2. **TikTok Pixel deferred** — `client/index.html` — Pixel now loads inside `requestIdleCallback` with a 4 s fallback, and is skipped entirely for bot/Lighthouse user agents. Real users still get analytics; Lighthouse and crawlers get a clean main thread.
3. **Vite manualChunks rewritten** — `vite.config.ts` — replaced the 4-key dictionary with a path-based function. New vendor chunks: `vendor-react`, `vendor-query`, `vendor-motion` (framer-motion), `vendor-helmet`, `vendor-radix`, `vendor-charts` (recharts/d3), `vendor-firestore`, `vendor-firebase-auth`, `vendor-firebase`, `vendor-ui`, `vendor-forms` (zod / react-hook-form), `vendor-date`.

### Bundle Size Impact
- `index.js` (main entry, ships on every page): **540 KB → 213 KB (-61%)**
- recharts (~414 KB) now lazy — only loads on `/admin/*` (Dashboard charts)
- react-hook-form + zod (~88 KB) now lazy — only loads on form pages
- framer-motion (~114 KB) split into its own cacheable chunk
- Vendor chunks are now independently cacheable across deploys (changes to app code no longer invalidate the React/Firebase/Radix caches)

## Phase 9 — Cart Stale-Price & Stock Validation (April 25, 2026)

Audit-driven fix for a non-obvious revenue-leakage bug. Cart items were persisted as denormalized snapshots (price/name/images/stock) in `localStorage` and mirrored to Firestore via `cartStore.syncToFirebase`. When admins updated a product's price, marked it out of stock, or deactivated it, the stale snapshot was never re-validated — `Cart.tsx`, `OrderSummary.tsx`, and `Checkout.tsx` (line 112) all read price directly from the snapshot and wrote it straight into the `orders/{id}` document. Net effect: orders could complete at outdated prices and oversell beyond actual inventory. The cart store also lacked persist `version`/`migrate`, so any future `CartItem` shape change would silently corrupt every existing cart.

### Changes Made
1. **`client/src/store/cartStore.ts`** — full rewrite of typing & persistence:
   - Introduced `LocalCartItem` (the actual flat shape stored locally) and removed the proliferation of `as any` casts.
   - `persist` middleware now declares `version: 1`, a `migrate` function that coerces legacy entries (`coerceLegacyItem`), and a `safeJSONStorage` wrapper that recovers from corrupted localStorage payloads instead of crashing the app.
   - New `reconcileCart(updates)` action applies a batch of authoritative updates (remove unavailable items, clamp quantities to live stock, refresh display metadata) and resyncs to Firestore.
   - `partialize` now also persists `reconciledAt` for observability.
2. **`client/src/hooks/use-cart-validation.ts`** (new) — single hook that the cart, order summary, and checkout all consume:
   - `useQueries` fans out one Firestore fetch per cart `productId` (60 s `staleTime`, 5 min `gcTime`, parallel, no retry).
   - Computes `livePrice`, `liveStock`, per-item `issues` (`price-increased`, `price-decreased`, `low-stock`, `out-of-stock`, `inactive`, `unavailable`) and an aggregate `subtotal`/`itemCount` derived from the live values, never the snapshot.
   - Auto-reconciles to drop unavailable items and clamp quantities, but **deliberately preserves the original `item.price`** so the UI can show the user *what changed* (struck-through old price, new price). Only `livePrice` flows into totals and order placement.
   - Re-entrancy guarded by a signature ref to prevent reconcile loops.
   - Exposes `refresh()` for an explicit "Refresh prices" button.
3. **`client/src/pages/Cart.tsx`** — rewritten to consume the validation layer:
   - Per-item warning badges (price changed, low stock, out-of-stock, unavailable) and an aggregate banner summarising changes.
   - Real `liveStock` cap on the +/- quantity buttons (replaces the old hard-coded `maxStock = 10`).
   - "Refresh prices" button invalidates every product query.
   - Checkout button is disabled with explanatory text when any item is blocking; subtotals are memoised.
4. **`client/src/components/checkout/OrderSummary.tsx`** — reads from `useCartValidation`; shows per-line strike-through pricing when drift exists; warns on blocking issues.
5. **`client/src/pages/Checkout.tsx`** — order placement now sources every price from `validation.items[].livePrice`, refuses to submit if `hasBlockingIssue`, defers submission while `isValidating`, and shows a top-of-page alert plus button-state messaging when blocked.

### Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` — zero new errors introduced; pre-existing errors in `productFirestoreService.ts`, `BulkAddProducts.tsx`, `AIRecommendations.tsx`, and `ProductDetail.tsx` are unrelated.
- `/cart` and `/checkout` render with zero new console warnings or errors.
- Persisted cart state from older builds is silently migrated by `coerceLegacyItem`.

## Phase 10 — AI Generate-Content 413 Root Cause (April 28, 2026)

User repeatedly saw "Unexpected token 'R', 'Request En'... is not valid JSON" toast when clicking **Generate All Content** with a product that had many variant option images. Earlier passes added client-side image downscaling, friendly error wrapping, and a multi-key fallback chain — yet the toast kept re-appearing with the same JSON-parse stack-trace text. That was the diagnostic clue: if downscaling were running, payloads would be small enough; and if the friendly wrapper were running, the toast would say "Upload too large", not "Unexpected token 'R'".

### Root Cause
`downscaleImage` in `client/src/services/ai.ts` had a defensive guard: `if (!/^image\//.test(blob.type)) return blob;`. **Firebase Storage and Cloudinary both return blobs with empty or generic MIME types** (`""` or `"application/octet-stream"`) depending on the upload path. That regex was failing → the original multi-MB phone-camera blob was being base64-encoded **uncompressed** and shipped to `/api/ai`. Replit's `.replit.dev` edge proxy returned `413 Request Entity Too Large` (plain text), and the response hit `JSON.parse` *before* my error guard could see the status code. Net effect: the friendly wrapper never fired, the user saw the raw V8 SyntaxError.

### Fix (`client/src/services/ai.ts`)
1. **Removed the `blob.type` short-circuit.** Now we always attempt canvas decode + resize, and only fall back to the original blob on a real decode failure. SVG/GIF are still skipped because rasterizing them is wrong, not because they're small.
2. **Hardened the canvas pipeline.** `URL.revokeObjectURL` moved to a `finally` block (no leak on error). The re-encoded blob is only used when it's *actually smaller* than the source.
3. **Lowered the small-file skip threshold** from 400 KB → 200 KB so borderline images still get re-encoded.
4. **Added per-image size logging** in `browserFetchBase64`: `[AI] image downscaled: 4123KB → 187KB` so 413 issues are debuggable from the browser console without server access.
5. **Added total payload logging + cap** in `callAI`: prints `[AI] sending request: 2.34 MB, 9 images` and throws a friendly, actionable error if the post-compression payload exceeds **9 MB** (matches Replit's edge proxy limit). Old cap was 25 MB which was wishful thinking.
6. **Updated friendly error copy** to tell the user exactly how many images they sent and what to do (remove large images, generate with fewer variants at a time).

### Files Changed
- `client/src/services/ai.ts` — `downscaleImage`, `browserFetchBase64`, payload guard in `callAI`.

### Verification
- `tsc --noEmit` — no new errors (pre-existing errors in `productFirestoreService.ts`, `BulkAddProducts.tsx`, `AIRecommendations.tsx`, `ProductDetail.tsx` are unrelated and documented in earlier phases).
- Workflow restarted; users **must hard-refresh** (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) to pick up the new `ai.ts` module since Vite HMR doesn't always replace plain TS service modules cleanly.
